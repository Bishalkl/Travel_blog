#Work part

Day1:
Today, I have set up all the necessary materials for developing a website, including folders for Sass and npm packages. Additionally, I have created a boilerplate to reset all default browser styles. Moreover, I have developed a function that enables us to convert units, and for responsive sizing, I have established breakpoints for all website sizes using mixin modules in Sass.

Day2:
Today, I have created a custom variable where I've stored all the color assets, font sizes, and font weights that will be used while developing the website. I've gathered all the variants and utilized a clamp to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
